The start of the program should be contained in a class named JavaGameEngine
this class should have a start method this method should start the JavaGameEngine

the user will have to extend this class when they want to create a game
in there they can change everything about the window and the game world if they want.

this will also be the main place to instaniate the gameobjects the user whants to 
have in the game world
all this costimazation should be done in the constructer and when the user wants to start 
they just call this.start(); and the game should run


start()
{
    this.frame.add(this.gameworld)
    this.frame.setVisibl(true)
}

then start should create a timer with a delay (which the user could change)
the timer should call on a update function in different thread. Thid thrad 
should update all the nodes in th objecthandler
