

Rendering is is happening in the src.javagameengine.Display.GameWorld.java class in the PaintComponent method.
This method is given to us from swing.

First we draw the objects from the Objecthandler (see Objecthandler) then we draw the components(if they have a display method)
from the objects inside of the objecthandler and then we are drawing thier componentes.

We also draws the colliders if the collider component has the isVisible boolean checked.
