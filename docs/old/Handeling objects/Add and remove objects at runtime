To add objects to the objecthandler in runtime
we can use the Main.instansiate() method. This method will add to a
static list in the CalcThread class (newObjects).
The newObjects list will after the update cykle has been completed
and all the objects inside of it to the Objecthandler list so we can render and
update them next update cycle

The removing of objects is similar to adding. We add the object to remove in the
removeObject list in the Calthread class by calling this.Destroy() in a component
this will after the current update cycle remove all the objects inside the Objecthandler
list from the removeobject list so the object no longer will be rendered or updated
