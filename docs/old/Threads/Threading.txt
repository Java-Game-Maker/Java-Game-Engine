The threads and gameloop is handeld in the src.JavaGameEngine.JavaGameEngine.java class

We have two threads CalThread, Main thread (the main program thread)
Calcthread is handeling all the component updates and the main thread is
handeling gui update

the Calcthread is run by a timer with a delay of 16 (this can be changed by Main.DELAY =/value/)
the calcthread runs a update function which sets the Objecthandler with the updated components
which are updated in another method called UpdateObjects

ObjectHandler.setObjects(UpdateObjects());

 private HashMap<Integer, Component> UpdateObjects()
{
    for (Map.Entry<Integer, Component> stringGameObjectEntry : objects.entrySet()) {
        Component s = (Component) ((Map.Entry) stringGameObjectEntry).getValue();
        s.Update();

    }
    return objects;
}
